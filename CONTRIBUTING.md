# Contributing Guidelines

This project aims to create a common source from all algorithms questions on LeetCode and values every single 
contribution made by the community.

We aim to solve all questions in the LeetCode Algorithms domain in as many languages as possible to show the 
different code styles and approaches that can be used to solve the same problem.
 
Contributing is very simple, simply identify a question from the [README](README.md) file that has yet to be solved in
a programming language of your choice. 

Solve that question and make sure that all tests pass on LeetCode, and the solution is accepted
and then create a pull request with the added solution and updated readme.
  
## Pull Request Process

1. Fork this repository to your github account and then clone your forked repository to your machine.
2. Say you solve some problem called __cars-and-trucks__ in using your favorite programming language, 
    say Python then simple add a new file called 
    `cars-and-trucks.py` in the `python` directory. 
3. In the [README](README.md) file, do not make any modification. The README file will be modified by __@anishLearnsToCode__.
